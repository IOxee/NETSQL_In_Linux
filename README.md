## Description
`SQLNetAutoDeploy` is a Bash script designed to automate the installation and configuration of Microsoft SQL Server, .NET SDK, and .NET Runtime on Ubuntu systems. It streamlines the setup process, making it straightforward to prepare a development or production environment for SQL Server and .NET applications.

## Features
- üöÄ **Easy to Use**: Simplifies the setup process with a single script execution.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Comprehensive**: Installs SQL Server, .NET SDK, .NET Runtime, and necessary tools.
- üîí **SSL Certificate Handling**: Provides options for SSL certificate issues with `sqlcmd`.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu (Tested on 22.04 LTS)
- Root or sudo privileges

## Usage
1. Clone or download the `SQLNetAutoDeploy` script.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x SQLNetAutoDeploy.sh`.
3. Run the script as root or with sudo: `sudo ./SQLNetAutoDeploy.sh`.

## What the Script Does
- Detects the Ubuntu version.
- Installs and configures Microsoft SQL Server.
- Installs .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.
- Sets up `mssql-tools` and `unixodbc-dev`.
- Configures PATH for SQL Server tools.
- Provides information for connecting to SQL Server both locally and remotely via SSMS on Windows.

## SSL Certificate Handling
In case of SSL certificate issues with `sqlcmd`, the script provides the option to use `-N -C` parameters to bypass SSL certificate verification.

## Connecting to SQL Server
After running the script, connect to your SQL Server instance:
- **Locally**: Use `sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P '<YourPassword>'`.
- **From Windows with SSMS**: Use the IP of the Ubuntu server, port `1433`, username `sa`, and your configured password.
